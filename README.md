Encode Solana Hackathon

For this Solana/Encode hackathon, I decided to try making a game using Unity and linking it up to the Solana network and allowing players to mint their high score as a NFT on solana blockchain.

I was very happy exploring the different elements of both Solana Unity SDK and Unity. 

Introducing - BATTLECRUISER MICRO

- In Starcraft Brood War, the battlecruiser is a heavy ship that takes forever to make. There also isn't much micro compared to other units. In this game, you get to navigate pipes like the flappy bird game
- I was super happy about implementing the particle system for the stars. That was a really nice touch for me
- Press "Space" to fly the battlecruiser

Solana Hackathon

- Here, you can log into your solana wallet using the Solana Unity SDK and see: (1) your account balance, and (2) your public key
- I thought this was really cool exploring the different prefabs Solana had. I mostly played around with the wallet prefab which grabbed the NFT logo and displayed the NFTs owned.
- In addition, instead of manipulating the metadata (which I set as one json file on github), I allowed players to mint their player scores into the blockchain by changing the name of the NFT to include their high score.
