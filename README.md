Encode Solana Hackathon

For this Solana/Encode hackathon, I decided to try making a game using Unity and linking it up to the Solana network and allowing players to mint their high score as a NFT on solana blockchain.

I was very happy exploring the different elements of both Solana Unity SDK and Unity. 

I actually wanted to use the Token-2022 Program extensions and spent the majority of time trying to get that to work in Unity. However, I couldn't get that done. I think next steps would be to implement a game using the Token-2022 progam because that would allow people to manipulate things much more dynamically and include hitpoints of the battlecruiser being changed as it navigates levels and being able to pause and resume the game with various stats recorded. In the future, I also want to introduce more challenge in the game like scourges that fly across the screen that try and hit the battlecruiser while the battlecruiser can shoot lasers. In any case, for this hackathon project....

Introducing - BATTLECRUISER MICRO

- In Starcraft Brood War, the battlecruiser is a heavy ship that takes forever to make. There also isn't much micro compared to other units. In this game, you get to navigate pipes like the flappy bird game
- I was super happy about implementing the particle system for the stars. That was a really nice touch for me
- Press "Space" to fly the battlecruiser

Solana Hackathon

- Here, you can log into your solana wallet using the Solana Unity SDK and see:
(1) your account balance, 
(2) your public key
(3) the NFTs you own
- I thought this was really cool exploring the different prefabs Solana had. I mostly played around with the wallet prefab which grabbed the NFT logo and displayed the NFTs owned.
- In addition, instead of manipulating the metadata (which I set as one json file on github), I allowed players to mint their player scores into the blockchain by changing the name of the NFT to include their high score.
